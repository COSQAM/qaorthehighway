            "summary": "For effective test automation concurrency, teams need to focus on test data, environment configuration, and whether their test automation is \"concurrency-ready\"",
            "abstract": "In 1984, Scorpions released their highly-successful album Love At First Sting. The opening track, Bad Boys Running Wild, speaks to me about test automation running amok in a DevOps environment. The lyrics include “if you don't play along with their games” which certainly had no relation to the concept of DevOps at the time, but perhaps now they do.\n\nWhen testing in a CI/CD pipeline, we often think “just create a task that fails the deployment if any tests fail”. Mechanically, that thought is not far off base. Practically, however, there are many facets of this flavor of testing that we must consider when running automated tests in a pipeline. Typically, the biggest considerations are execution duration and consistency; we don't want to wait “too long” for our deployment and we want the tests to behave the same way on each execution.\n\nRunning our automated test scripts in parallel can absolutely reduce the duration of an automation suite’s execution. Having success and consistency with concurrent execution, however, requires upfront work to obtain detailed knowledge of the application being tested and dependencies in the automation suite. Omitting this work will result in our automation being unable to get out of its way; automation will inevitably run wild.\n\nAdditionally, a deploy-on-every-commit, possibly even to production, is the end goal for many teams. There are additional considerations for being able to accomplish this goal because it’s likely no humans will touch the modified software until it’s actually in production. How do we handle test failures in the pipeline? How do we handle bugs that escape into production?\n\nJoin Paul Grizzaffi as he walks through important aspects of test automation parallelization, commit-to-production, gating tests, and logging; aspects that must be addressed to be successful when implementing automation in a CI/CD pipeline for a DevOps-focused organization.",

            "abstract": "Shift left! Testing is everyone's responsibility! Prevent defects instead of detecting them later! Build quality in. An inevitable reference to Deming. Ready to play some Quality Engineering Bingo? In this talk, Caleb will cover common \"catch phrases\" associated with Quality Engineering, including both some of the strongest arguments in favor of QE concept, and where the logic falls short of justifying the complete elimination of dedicated testers.\n\nMany of the ideas of Quality Engineering in software are taken from the discipline of the same name in manufacturing. While there are parallels, it's also easy to gloss over the differences. Manufacturing processes are, by definition, repeatable. Software development, in contrast, is often messier than we care to admit, because it's developed by fallible humans, not robots.\n\nSo let's shift left and find ways to catch defects earlier or prevent them in the first place. Let's understand what it means for testing to be everyone's responsibility. But let's also get more specific about what that means for each role. Let's also acknowledge that no matter how much we streamline and improve our development processes, nothing in software is infallible. We still need to consider how we might be fooled, or miss something, and how we can improve our efforts to find defects after implementation as well.",

While original in their designs, a common theme for modern web development is to build using separate components that comprise a full web page. However, most testing occurs directly at a page-level, and usually only in a later stages or during “handoffs.” This creates a problem where there is a gap between unit and feature testing.\n\nEnter component testing: picture it as “unit testing,” but for individual web components. In this demo, we will demonstrate how modern test frameworks, like Cypress and WebDriverIO, allow for component testing, to “shift left” and perform regressions earlier in the cycle. This allows feature testing to be more focused and less comprehensive, while uniting a stronger formula for an automated test plan overall.",

            "abstract": "Test data is a pernicious issue facing every IT operation. Teams have challenges with stale data, differences with data between environments, referential integrity across systems, generating data dynamically for testing at runtime, having control over their data, or even understanding what data they actually need. The challenge is compounded for large enterprises with complex interconnected systems all overseen by internal compliance and external regulatory bodies. In this presentation, we'll explore the steps you can take to defeat the test data management problem, such as:\n\n- access control over test data\n- identifying the right data to subset for testing\n- using data to control how tests execute in different environments\n- avoiding the use of shared data\n- tooling to both generate and manage test data",
