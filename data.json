The phrase uses just a few, small words to express many, big ideas. And so, it is valuable and critical to understand what each word means individually in order to better understand the ideas they convey collectively.\n\nSemantics is the study of meaning in words. The session begins with a brief and broad overview of semantics and related ideas. This sets the stage for deep analysis of each individual word in the phrase above and its potential meaning. We collaboratively consider:\n\nTesters – What might this word mean to different people and in different contexts?\n\nDo/Don’t – What do normative and descriptive statements have to do with it?\n\nHelp – How does the inclusion/exclusion of this word affect the meaning of the phrase?\n\nPrevent/Detect – What does causality and relativism have to do with which word we choose?\n\nProblems – What exactly is the thing that is being prevented or detected?\n\nThis session demystifies and promotes semantics, and goes beyond wordplay to introduce critical concepts that have practical impacts on testers, their roles, and their responsibilities.",

            "abstract": "Good data for testing can be a nightmare to manage. Sometimes, teams don’t have much control over the data in their systems under test—it’s just dropped in, and it can change arbitrarily. Other times, teams need to build their own data sets, either before testing or during testing. Inaccurate data can leave test gaps. Incorrect or stale data can break tests. Large data can consume too much time. Ugh!\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover strategies for defeating many types of test data nightmares:\n\n* recognizing the difference between product data and test case data\n* deciding when to prepare data statically beforehand or dynamically during testing\n* using data to control how tests run or reflect product state\n* hard-coding values versus discovering data in the system\n* avoiding collisions on shared data\n\nThe strategies we cover can be applied to any project in any language, especially Django. After this talk, you will wake up from the nightmare and handle test data cleanly and efficiently like a pro!",

            "abstract": "Companies often get caught in a costly cycle. They rush to get a testing tool in place because it will “solve most of their manual testing problems.” Then spend a hard 6-12 months implementing a solution which isn’t quite fitting their needs. And it’s not doing everything the salesman said it could. As the time to renew licenses approaches your faced with a hard decision: replace this tool with another (potentially repeating the difficult implementation process for a second time next year) OR grind it out and adjust your processes to make the tool fit. Neither path is a good one.\n\nA more important question to ask is “How did you get yourself into this difficult position to begin with?” As I talk to more and more organizations in this difficult position, I see a pattern emerging. None of them have an over-arching Test Strategy in place. The tool they chose isn’t solving “most of their manual testing problems” because they have not taken the time to thoroughly identify what all those problems are, they have not taken the time to thoroughly identify where they think they want to be in 2 or 5 years, and they have not taken the time to think through how Tool A or B can help them through their journey from current to future state.\n\nA well put-together Test Strategy can help you guide these treacherous waters. In this presentation Mr. Eakin will walk your through the 5 W’s of testing: What? Where? When? Who? And HoW? What tests are needed in your full tech stack? Where (which environments) will these test be executed in? When will these tests be executed? Who will create, monitor and maintain the tests? After you have asked and answered the first 4 W’s, you are now ready to ask and answer the last: hoW (using which tools) will these tests be executed?\n\nWith a Test Strategy in hand, you will be ready to overcome any obstacle thrown at your team and do it without missing a beat. It will become your best friend.",

Do you find it hard to express what quality really looks to your senior leadership team?\n\nWhile running Quality Engineering Programs, I often had these challenges in determining what work we should be delivering. One of the tools I utilized to help navigate and establish direction was running a Quality Service Delivery Review which helped establish:\n- What does healthy quality look like in your engineering organization (code quality, engineering process, deliverables?)\n- Is the Quality Organization successful in delivering this (what KPI’s and how is this consumed)?\n- Is our overall engineering output actually delivering with quality (what happens if it’s not)?\n\nAre our customers satisfied with our product and how can we determine this?\n\nBeing able to answer the questions above will allow you to align with the engineering leadership team on what quality initiatives should be worked on quarter to quarter.\n\nMy talk will focus on the following:\n- The case for utilizing a feedback mechanism like the Quality Service Delivery Review\n- What kind of content, metrics, and data should you be preparing and sharing\n- How to drive engagement with the participants in your Service Delivery Review\n- Utilizing the above to create alignment to build out your roadmap for execution",

My experience working with organizations large and small as they try to create Products has allowed me to see the patterns of success and failure. Along the way, I've dedicated myself to helping individuals and organizations use Product Thinking as a predictable path to success.\n\nIt's awesome to work with Jeff Patton & Associates, heading our Product Coaching and Consulting efforts, helping organizations implement ways of working that shift their focus away from creating output. Through training, coaching, and consulting, we empower their people to organize and collaborate to deliver outcomes and impacts that create predictable market success.",

            "abstract": "As an QA person, your goal is to make software is ready for go-live.  You even may be \"Agile,\" working with a cross-functional team of engineers to create working code in iterations.  Even so, meaningful collaborations with Product Owners and Product Managers are usually a challenge. Often these roles only show up only just before a release or when there is a customer-facing error.  This behavior leaves the team, the QA department, or a solidary tester wondering how to prioritize their work for the maximum benefit to the organization.  Achieving the QA mission without customer, user, or business input is difficult.  What's more, getting it wrong can lead to re-work or costly product failure. This lack of engagement is a wide-spread problem that seems to have gotten even worse in recent years.  Why?\n\nThis lively session will reveal three key causes of this this lack of Product engagement.\n\nParticipants will also be introduced to Product Thinking tools such as OKRs and User Story Mapping that tend to get better engagement from Product Managers and Organizational Leadership at large.  You will go home with practical tips for fostering valuable conversations with Product and other roles who desperately need to understand the importance of QA.",

            "abstract": "In the frantic race to automate everything, one critical fact often gets overlooked… that test automation is NOT testing. Many organizations equate a comprehensive automated test suite with an effective software testing function. However, their definition of test automation is often limited to the automated execution of scripted test steps. Even in the best case scenario, this approach can give a false sense of security - especially when executing automated checks is the only “testing” that's performed in the development cycle.\n\nIn this session, Lee will discuss why he sees the craft of software testing being swallowed up by test automation. He will help you think beyond just execution of scripted tests and apply automation principles more generally to testing activities. You will learn how to look at testing and automation as complimentary activities and take back techniques for using a context-driven approach to automaton to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of your software testing.",

For a while now, the go to resource for the research has been the paid sources like “Gartner” which unfortunately losing their edge in the market by favoring only commercial tools.\n\nIn this presentation, we would like to emphasize on four popular open-source web automation tools (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Test Cafe) that any company can benefit from. We will be comparing these frameworks based on same benchmark with certain parameters. This talk also focuses on the working examples and clearly differentiates the capabilities of Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, and Test Cafe.
