            "title": "Human Experience Testing: Redefining Quality in the Age of AI",
            "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming an accepted means of accelerating software engineering and testing activities.  Many organizations have already integrated AI into their software development lifecycle, and the demand for AI-assisted engineering continues to grow year over year.  A key motivating factor behind the demand is the promise of increased speed and efficiency through automation. Software testing is a prime candidate for AI acceleration due to the generally high costs and significant manual effort involved in validation and verification.  As a result, we are seeing an exponential growth in the application and development of tools to support AI-driven test automation.c\n\nBut what does the adoption of AI-driven automation mean for the future of software testing?  Is AI going to replace manual testers and/or test automation engineers? It seems like these questions are quickly growing old and repetitive because no one is providing definitive answers based on practical, real-world analysis. Join industry expert Tariq King as he takes you on a journey into the future of software testing. Tariq firmly believes that AI will take over software testing and permanently transform the quality engineering landscape. He postulates that the future of testing will be focused on evaluating human experiences, including testing digital, physical, and experiential touchpoints. In the age of AI, human experience testing will not just be viewed as a quality assurance function, but as a core component of an organization’s business strategy. Welcome to the future of quality where AI specifies, designs, codes, and tests software, leaving the humans to do the one thing the machines can’t – test the human experience.",

            "abstract": "Everything starts with trust. It is the foundation of personal and professional relationships, leadership abilities, innovation, collaboration, business stability, entire nations, and much more. And often, trust is enough. However, misplaced trust—trusting the wrong thing, the wrong amount, or at the wrong time—can have significant, negative consequences.\n\nBut how can we know when trust is enough? And what do we do when it is not? By practicing skepticism!\n\nSkepticism is frequently equated with cynicism or pessimism, and skeptics are often seen as suspicious or even jaded. But, real skepticism is actually a neutral stance that suspends belief until justified evidence is available. Healthy skepticism is more closely aligned with curiosity and caution. And it can help us avoid negative consequences and move forward when trust is not enough.\n\nPracticing skepticism involves fact-checking, being aware of biases, asking good questions, and much more. And it is all especially relevant with the rise of Artificial Intelligence, a powerful yet complex technology. Understanding AI and practicing skepticism can help us use it effectively and safely.\n\nJoin me as I explore trust, promote skepticism, offer ways to develop a skeptical mindset, and show how these ideas apply to AI and other contexts by providing practical tips to better navigate our world.",

This paper explores how organizations can effectively transform their QA strategy to embrace automation without losing the benefits of manual testing, particularly when faced with challenges such as increased test complexity, growing product scope, and the need for faster release cycles. By leveraging low-code solutions such as Mabl, companies can enhance efficiency, improve test coverage, and scale their operations without completely overhauling their workforce. Factorio is a strategy game that emphasizes automation and efficiency, requiring players to gradually replace manual labor with automated systems to scale production. Drawing insights from this game, this paper illustrates the balance between manual and automated processes in software testing, demonstrating how a gradual shift to automation enables teams to focus on high-value tasks while maintaining manual testing where it adds the most value.",

I’m passionate about serving others through mentorship, collaboration, and cultivating safe spaces for growth. And my leadership strategy is three fold: Equipping people with knowledge and perspective, Encouraging people with truth and empathy when hard times come, and Empowering people with opportunities and resources to succeed and overcome new challenges.\n\nAfter graduating from James Madison University with a BS in Integrated Science and Technology, I began my career in the software industry as a web developer writing in ColdFusion and C#/.NET with a healthy dose of SQL. After four years, I moved to North Carolina to pursue a MA in Ministry Leadership at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. During my second year, I began my search for a developer position in the area and this is when my career began to shift. I applied to a C#/.NET role and was asked questions about cloud architecture and my plan for working full time while studying part time. When they hired me, I was excited about jumping back into development. But to my surprise, they tasked me with starting their test automation effort with Java and Selenium and to train off-shore testers on the framework. This is how I got into testing!\n\nFast forward nine years, I’m now a Senior Software Test Engineer at WillowTree (a Telus Digital company) with experience building B2B and B2C solutions with diverse teams for clients in various industries including travel, food & beverage, and automotive. Throughout my fifteen year career, I’ve learned that technology is simply another context or vehicle for building relationships with people, whether they are the people on your team, the clients you’re serving, or the users you’re engaging. I’ve also learned that work is deeply personal, especially when we bring our full selves to environments where we spend time and energy that we cannot get back.\n\nHere are some fun facts about me. My wife and I enjoy watching women’s basketball both college and professional. I have a tee shirt for every airport that I’ve visited (including layovers). If you bring up Star Trek or the Nickelodeon cartoon “Hey Arnold”, you’ll be speaking my love language.
