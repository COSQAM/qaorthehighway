            "abstract": "In this talk, Ronald will cover 3 main ideas:\n- How to create a culture of quality that supports growth\n- How to align teams to your Company growth metric\n- How to drive better customer experience with Local Personas\n\nA single bug report forever changed the way I thought about QA. I was approached by a tech company experiencing rapid global growth, with the exception of Indonesia. After conducting a localised functional test, we found the ‘last name’ field was compulsory when signing up to the app. But - why wouldn’t you enter a last name? Why was this so significant? It turns out that 40% of the Indonesian population doesn’t have a surname (due to the country’s political history) and therefore couldn’t sign up.\n\nOnce this field was removed, user adoption increased and unlocked a market of 262 million people. We already knew testing could provide valuable results, but it was this particular case that showed us it’s true value, and how it has a measurable impact on business growth.\n\nBy searching deeper, to figure out if this case was just an outlier, I interviewed over 120 of the world’s top leaders in QA and Engineering from companies such as Etsy, Google, Airbnb, HelloFresh and more. I was able to uncover how the world’s most successful tech companies deliver high-quality software and accelerate growth - the focus of my talk.\n\nI discovered that, at the heart of every successful quality team, was a leader who had determined how to effectively leverage quality strategy to accelerate business growth. Learn the secret to how the world’s top-performing QA and Engineering leaders change cultures of quality, to one that allows them to deliver high-quality software with speed, and accelerate the growth of their business. Learn how they shift company perspectives on the value of testing, to future-proofing your product for world-class customer experiences.",

            "summary": "For effective test automation concurrency, teams need to focus on test data, environment configuration, and whether their test automation is \"concurrency-ready\"",
            "abstract": "In 1984, Scorpions released their highly-successful album Love At First Sting. The opening track, Bad Boys Running Wild, speaks to me about test automation running amok in a DevOps environment. The lyrics include “if you don't play along with their games” which certainly had no relation to the concept of DevOps at the time, but perhaps now they do.\n\nWhen testing in a CI/CD pipeline, we often think “just create a task that fails the deployment if any tests fail”. Mechanically, that thought is not far off base. Practically, however, there are many facets of this flavor of testing that we must consider when running automated tests in a pipeline. Typically, the biggest considerations are execution duration and consistency; we don't want to wait “too long” for our deployment and we want the tests to behave the same way on each execution.\n\nRunning our automated test scripts in parallel can absolutely reduce the duration of an automation suite’s execution. Having success and consistency with concurrent execution, however, requires upfront work to obtain detailed knowledge of the application being tested and dependencies in the automation suite. Omitting this work will result in our automation being unable to get out of its way; automation will inevitably run wild.\n\nAdditionally, a deploy-on-every-commit, possibly even to production, is the end goal for many teams. There are additional considerations for being able to accomplish this goal because it’s likely no humans will touch the modified software until it’s actually in production. How do we handle test failures in the pipeline? How do we handle bugs that escape into production?\n\nJoin Paul Grizzaffi as he walks through important aspects of test automation parallelization, commit-to-production, gating tests, and logging; aspects that must be addressed to be successful when implementing automation in a CI/CD pipeline for a DevOps-focused organization.",

            "abstract": "Shift left! Testing is everyone's responsibility! Prevent defects instead of detecting them later! Build quality in. An inevitable reference to Deming. Ready to play some Quality Engineering Bingo? In this talk, Caleb will cover common \"catch phrases\" associated with Quality Engineering, including both some of the strongest arguments in favor of QE concept, and where the logic falls short of justifying the complete elimination of dedicated testers.\n\nMany of the ideas of Quality Engineering in software are taken from the discipline of the same name in manufacturing. While there are parallels, it's also easy to gloss over the differences. Manufacturing processes are, by definition, repeatable. Software development, in contrast, is often messier than we care to admit, because it's developed by fallible humans, not robots.\n\nSo let's shift left and find ways to catch defects earlier or prevent them in the first place. Let's understand what it means for testing to be everyone's responsibility. But let's also get more specific about what that means for each role. Let's also acknowledge that no matter how much we streamline and improve our development processes, nothing in software is infallible. We still need to consider how we might be fooled, or miss something, and how we can improve our efforts to find defects after implementation as well.",

While original in their designs, a common theme for modern web development is to build using separate components that comprise a full web page. However, most testing occurs directly at a page-level, and usually only in a later stages or during “handoffs.” This creates a problem where there is a gap between unit and feature testing.\n\nEnter component testing: picture it as “unit testing,” but for individual web components. In this demo, we will demonstrate how modern test frameworks, like Cypress and WebDriverIO, allow for component testing, to “shift left” and perform regressions earlier in the cycle. This allows feature testing to be more focused and less comprehensive, while uniting a stronger formula for an automated test plan overall.",

            "abstract": "The world that IT and QA live in is changing rapidly. Business pressures are accelerating expectations for how fast new features are released into production. Agile cycles are increasing our release frequency for delivering those features. DevOps is disrupting the entire pipeline and enabling organizations to truly differentiate themselves from the competition.\n\nOften our testing practices are stuck at the end of the development cycle and short-changed due to time overruns earlier in the lifecycle. QA is getting stuck to right rather than shifting left. However, DevOps and continuous flow concepts are changing when, how, and how often testing can be done.\n\nContinuous Testing enables a true “shift left” for testing elements and provides agility for how those testing elements are accomplished. Continuous Testing helps you succeed in this new high-speed reality.\n\nEnsuring quality is not a simple task. It has become more complex with the new pressures, directions,and requirements that today’s QA organizations face such as: many different types of testing, “stuck right, and left behind by DevOps. Continuous Testing can help address these QA challenges.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll address the technology, process, people, and cultural changes Continuous Testing requires. I’ll also explore how Continuous Testing helps QA keep pace and why QA must move towards a continuous testing footing to achieve fast, predictable, quality DevOps and delivery.\n\nTakeaways from this talk\nAttendees will become more familiar with, or be introduced to, Continuous Testing including its drivers,QA challenges, as well as the key elements that make up Continuous Testing. We’ll delve into how Continuous Testing is enabling a true “shift left” for testing elements and providing agility for how those testing elements are accomplished.\n\nA key takeaway includes the nine key elements teams must-have in order to be successful in moving towards a Continuous Testing footing and DevOps concepts.\n\nThese Continuous Testing elements include:\n• Shift Left: Key to moving testing to earlier in the lifecycle and pipeline\n• Test Automation: Critical to meet faster cycle requirements and maintain confidence and quality\n• Pipeline Integration: Properly fitting QA into the life cycle and tool chain to connect traditional silos\n• Ephemeral Environments: Building ephemeral environments that can be consistently, quickly and cost effectively spun up and torn down\n• Test Data Management: Virtual, masked, production-quality data\n• Continuous Monitoring: Monitoring throughout the lifecycle and environment stack\n• Service Virtualization: Virtualization capabilities allowing test to execute regardless of availability\n• Change Culture: Changing the way people think at every level of the organization, the way people are connected, and the way they work\n• Align People and Organization: Shifting responsibilities and empowering many teams and individuals to contribute to the quality of delivery\n\nNo matter where you are on your Continuous Testing journey, the audience will learn how a pragmatic roadmap and high-quality delivery that will help your organization maximize quality while keeping pace with today’s business requirements.\n\nThe outcome? Better alignment with business goals today—and greater resilience for technology evolution in the future.",

            "abstract": "Are you grappling with flaky tests or struggling to align automation scripts with the latest application changes? Do you find yourself spending more time on execution and analysis than actual scripting? Fear not, as self-healing and auto result analysis are here to save the day. However, implementing self-healing traditionally requires costly commercial tools, leading to increased overall expenses.\n\nBut what if you could achieve self-healing using open-source tools like Selenium or WebdriverIO? Generative AI APIs, which offer a solution to seamlessly integrate self-healing and auto failure analysis into your automation framework without spending a single penny.\n\nThis workshop will dive into the practical implementation of self-healing in your automation scripts to adapt to the latest application changes effortlessly. In the event of a failure, the system will conduct a root cause analysis to determine whether it's an application issue, infrastructure issue, or a script issue caused by locator changes. If the failure is due to locator changes, the system will automatically update the locator values and continue execution. So, join us to understand how you improve the overall scripts health using the self-healing feature",
