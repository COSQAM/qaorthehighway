Large data can consume too much time. Ugh!\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover strategies for defeating many types of test data nightmares:\n\n* recognizing the difference between product data and test case data\n* deciding when to prepare data statically beforehand or dynamically during testing\n* using data to control how tests run or reflect product state\n* hard-coding values versus discovering data in the system\n* avoiding collisions on shared data\n\nThe strategies we cover can be applied to any project in any language, especially Django.

They rush to get a testing tool in place because it will “solve most of their manual testing problems.” Then spend a hard 6-12 months implementing a solution which isn’t quite fitting their needs. And it’s not doing everything the salesman said it could. As the time to renew licenses approaches your faced with a hard decision: replace this tool with another (potentially repeating the difficult implementation process for a second time next year) OR grind it out and adjust your processes to make the tool fit. Neither path is a good one.\n\nA more important question to ask is “How did you get yourself into this difficult position to begin with?” As I talk to more and more organizations in this difficult position, I see a pattern emerging. None of them have an over-arching Test Strategy in place. The tool they chose isn’t solving “most of their manual testing problems” because they have not taken the time to thoroughly identify what all those problems are, they have not taken the time to thoroughly identify where they think they want to be in 2 or 5 years, and they have not taken the time to think through how Tool A or B can help them through their journey from current to future state.\n\nA well put-together Test Strategy can help you guide these treacherous waters. In this presentation Mr. Eakin will walk your through the 5 W’s of testing: What? Where? When? Who? And HoW? What tests are needed in your full tech stack? Where (which environments) will these test be executed in? When will these tests be executed? Who will create, monitor and maintain the tests? After you have asked and answered the first 4 W’s, you are now ready to ask and answer the last: hoW (using which tools) will these tests be executed?\n\nWith a Test Strategy in hand, you will be ready to overcome any obstacle thrown at your team and do it without missing a beat.

Whether it's UI vs. API, white box vs. black box, happy path, \"manual\" vs. automated, the testing field seems to fall squarely in the first group in the classic quip, \"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who divide everything into two or more groups, and those that don't.\" However, when we overfocus on categorizing and bucketing our testing efforts, we risk missing critical bugs that don't cooperate with our neat categorization of testing efforts. Thinking outside the box (or bucket!) can generate test ideas that don't neatly fit into commonly-defined test types--and that's a good thing. In this talk, I provide some practical examples from my own experience of finding problems \"between the buckets\" and encourage you to unbucket your test activities to do the same. You might come up with some interesting ideas of your own by considering how to combine ideas from traditionally separate buckets.",

You even may be \"Agile,\" working with a cross-functional team of engineers to create working code in iterations.  Even so, meaningful collaborations with Product Owners and Product Managers are usually a challenge. Often these roles only show up only just before a release or when there is a customer-facing error.  This behavior leaves the team, the QA department, or a solidary tester wondering how to prioritize their work for the maximum benefit to the organization.  Achieving the QA mission without customer, user, or business input is difficult.  What's more, getting it wrong can lead to re-work or costly product failure. This lack of engagement is a wide-spread problem that seems to have gotten even worse in recent years.  Why?\n\nThis lively session will reveal three key causes of this this lack of Product engagement.\n\nParticipants will also be introduced to Product Thinking tools such as OKRs and User Story Mapping that tend to get better engagement from Product Managers and Organizational Leadership at large.
