However, dependencies on unavailable, costly, or evolving services create bottlenecks that hinder development and delay testing cycles. Traditional approaches fail to provide the flexibility and scalability required for efficient software delivery.\n\nThis session explores a methodology that enables teams to simulate dependencies with realistic, controlled responses, allowing development and testing to proceed uninterrupted.  By reducing constraints associated with third-party APIs, legacy systems, and evolving microservices, organizations can accelerate software delivery, improve test coverage, and enhance collaboration across teams. Attendees will learn how this approach integrates into CI/CD pipelines, supports automated testing strategies, and reduces operational costs while ensuring high software quality.\n\nJoin us to discover how adopting this strategy can transform the way your teams develop, test, and deploy software, eliminating common roadblocks that slow down innovation.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/djvano/","twitter":"@djvano","website":"https://www.parasoft.com","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
