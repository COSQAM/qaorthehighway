","bio2":"","title":"Comparing the four popular opensource automation tools","abstract":"\"One Size doesn't fit all\" - Similarly there is no one automation framework that worked for one company will be best fit for the other. With so many popular opensource automation technologies available, it is a challenge for Automation Engineers to identify a tool that is best suited for their team and company needs. For a while now, the go to resource for the research has been the paid sources like “Gartner” which unfortunately losing their edge in the market by favoring only commercial tools.\n\nIn this presentation, we would like to emphasize on four popular open-source web automation tools (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Test Cafe) that any company can benefit from. We will be comparing these frameworks based on same benchmark with certain parameters. This talk also focuses on the working examples and clearly differentiates the capabilities of Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, and Test Cafe. The audience would leave the session with clear understanding on what these frameworks are and how they work, so they can choose which one to use in the future.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-chaitanya-bandarupalli-a1038436/","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
