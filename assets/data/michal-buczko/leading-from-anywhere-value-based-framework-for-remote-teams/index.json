While organisations have adapted their operational practices, the human aspects of leadership - building trust, fostering growth, and advocating for teams - require a reimagining in the virtual space. This presentation introduces a practical, value-based framework developed through real-world experience in leading distributed teams across multiple time zones, cultures, and organisational contexts.\n\nRemote leadership is not just managing from a distance - it's about building an environment where teams thrive despite remote separation. The framework that will be presented is focused on three foundational values, each supported by three specific, actionable goals that together is author's personal approach to remote teamâ€™s leadership excellence. Through this approach and methods leaders can extend their own practices to expand their teams to be resilient, high-performing while maintaining human connection in virtual environments. This framework can be applied as a whole or by particular methods and practices.\n\nDrawing from personal journeys containing both successes and failures in implementing different principles, this presentation based on the final author's way of leading the team offers practical insights into how leaders can move from basic remote management to create truly engaging and happy remote teams with a core role of their leadership as the foundation of the success. The framework addresses crucial aspects like building psychological safety, fostering professional growth, and ensuring team visibility - all while supporting the complexities of remote work.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/buczkomichal/","twitter":"","website":"https://buczkomichal.ghost.io/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
