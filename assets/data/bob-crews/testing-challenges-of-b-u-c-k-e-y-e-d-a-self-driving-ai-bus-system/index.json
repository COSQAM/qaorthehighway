Whether you’re a hands-on developer, a manual or automation test engineer, a test lead, manager, executive, or owner, AI’s disruptive power hits you differently. Now more than ever, we’re charged not just with delivering innovation, but with safeguarding the lifeblood of the enterprise—because one slip in quality can ripple through an entire organization. In this high-energy, fully immersive exercise, you’ll dive into a gripping, fictitious AI project alongside an IT Executive Board, dissecting the six core testing challenge categories and learning how to conquer them from day one. Buckle up—your mission starts now!\n\nThe Mission: YOU, the attendees, will be participating as members of the Checkpoint Technologies Executive IT Team. We have been awarded a prestigious contract by Imaginary Corporation to test their state-of-the-art, fully autonomous self-driving bus system B.U.C.K.E.Y.E.D. (Bus Using Cognitive Knowledge, Engineered to Yield Efficient Driving), developed for the state of Ohio The AI system is a strong AI, meaning it has a higher level of autonomous reasoning, learning, and adaptability than traditional narrow AI systems. This makes testing uniquely complex and high-stake.\n\nLed and moderated by Bob Crews, CEO of Checkpoint Technologies, we must identify and provide Imaginary Corp. with a categorized list of our primary testing challenges. Your goal is to ensure project success, minimize and mitigate risk, and protect Checkpoint Technologies and Imaginary Corporation (from potential liabilities arising from negligence). Additional details and guidance will be provided at the beginning of our “meeting”.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Interfaith Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-crews-checkpointech/","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
