In many cases when the system is not secure, performant or accessible, its functionality is affected or it’s not functional at all. In this talk, I will show techniques and tools that we use that will help you improve your ability to observe the system while you are performing functional testing in order to provide feedback about the so-called “non-functional” properties. I will also discuss how to properly prioritize the different characteristics of the system in order to focus your efforts on what is more important to your business at each moment.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicotoledo/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/fltoledo","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
