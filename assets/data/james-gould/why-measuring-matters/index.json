However, manual testing remains invaluable for tasks requiring human intuition, creativity, and exploratory skills. This paper explores how organizations can effectively transform their QA strategy to embrace automation without losing the benefits of manual testing, particularly when faced with challenges such as increased test complexity, growing product scope, and the need for faster release cycles. By leveraging low-code solutions such as Mabl, companies can enhance efficiency, improve test coverage, and scale their operations without completely overhauling their workforce. Factorio is a strategy game that emphasizes automation and efficiency, requiring players to gradually replace manual labor with automated systems to scale production. Drawing insights from this game, this paper illustrates the balance between manual and automated processes in software testing, demonstrating how a gradual shift to automation enables teams to focus on high-value tasks while maintaining manual testing where it adds the most value.","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"West Ballroom","linkedin":"www.linkedin.com/in/jamesgould98011","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
