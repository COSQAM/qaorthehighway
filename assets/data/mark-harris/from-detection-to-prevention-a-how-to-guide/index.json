Data proves that it is 10X more costly to correct a problem than to prevent it.\n\nIT Organizations are transforming their business models to be digital and product-centric which, in turn, is forcing the need to get things right the first time, and with increased speed. Traditional application centric quality assurance models with dedicated QA teams driven by standard QA SLAs have become a bottleneck to achieve the intended business goals. This has resulted in organizations transforming from Quality control to a Quality Engineering approach, shifting left within the SDLC lifecycle by embedding intelligent automation with self-healing, integrating Dev-QA model & business quality assurance, and embarking on a Quality Engineering transformation journey.\n\nWith this raised bar on expectations from quality engineering, what aspects of testing need to be considered to realize the full benefits, preventing potential risks, and effectively contributing to business objectives?\n\nJoin us for a presentation and discover on how to reduce cost of quality, achieve speed, and move the needle from detection to prevention!\n\nQuestions we will cover include:\n- What does the future of Quality engineering will look like?\n- What are the key considerations for Quality Engineering?\n- What tools and accelerators are available in the market?\n- How can I transform my team to enable QE?\n- How can I perform effective change management associated with culture and mindset?","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Interfaith Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markhar","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
