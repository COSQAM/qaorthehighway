Do you find yourself spending more time on execution and analysis than actual scripting? Fear not, as self-healing and auto result analysis are here to save the day. However, implementing self-healing traditionally requires costly commercial tools, leading to increased overall expenses.\n\nBut what if you could achieve self-healing using open-source tools like Selenium or WebdriverIO? Generative AI APIs, which offer a solution to seamlessly integrate self-healing and auto failure analysis into your automation framework without spending a single penny.\n\nThis workshop will dive into the practical implementation of self-healing in your automation scripts to adapt to the latest application changes effortlessly. In the event of a failure, the system will conduct a root cause analysis to determine whether it's an application issue, infrastructure issue, or a script issue caused by locator changes. If the failure is due to locator changes, the system will automatically update the locator values and continue execution. So, join us to understand how you improve the overall scripts health using the self-healing feature","time":"1:55 - 2:55","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/jigesh_shah","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
