She is the Director of Quality Engineering at Guild Education and a Principal Consultant at Disrupt Testing, where she assists companies to continuously improve the pursuit of quality software—from design to delivery and everything in between. In her software test and quality engineering careers, Melissa has focused on building and organizing teams around three major tenets—efficiency, innovation, and culture – and uses the Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) approach for determining ways in which team members can assess, implement and report on day to day activities so the gap between need and value is as small as possible.","bio2":"","title":"Automation - We're Doing it Wrong","abstract":"The term automation as it pertains to software testing has been a driving force in defining the software testing industry. For many years, we've used it as a catch-all to determine whether a tester, testing team, or IT organization is successful. In this talk, we will discuss the five misconceptions that are pervasive within companies - including using a percentage or number of test cases to define success and specifying a title/role for those who automate and matrixing that role across teams versus embedding it within the project they are supporting. Melissa will discuss re-booting our current thinking of automation and show tactics to address the five misconceptions that have contributed to what many of us would consider one of the wedges that divide the testing industry. In addition, she will share practical and proven approaches you can take back with you to show immediate and valuable results.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-tondi-186551/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/melissatondi","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
