In this talk, we’ll explore how AI can accelerate API automation by automatically generating test suites from OpenAPI specifications and Postman collections, significantly reducing manual effort and increasing test coverage.\n\nBy attending, you’ll learn how to:\nAccelerate API Automation: Understand how AI-driven approaches can streamline the creation of test suites, minimizing repetitive tasks and improving efficiency.\n\nEnhance Testing Confidence: Explore how AI-powered automation enhances test consistency, reliability, and maintainability.\n\nValidate AI Tools Effectively: Gain insights into the challenges of testing AI-driven automation and best practices for ensuring accuracy and trustworthiness.\n\nWe’ll begin with an overview of the foundational concepts behind AI-assisted API automation, followed by a demonstration of how AI can rapidly convert API definitions into comprehensive test suites. As an example, we’ll showcase an open-source AI Agent that applies these principles, available at GitHub. Finally, we’ll discuss effective strategies for validating AI-generated tests, helping teams adopt similar approaches with confidence.\n\nJoin us to discover how AI-driven test automation can improve efficiency, expand test coverage, and help deliver more reliable software—faster.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-pereira/","twitter":"@damianpereira86","website":"https://github.com/damianpereira86","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
