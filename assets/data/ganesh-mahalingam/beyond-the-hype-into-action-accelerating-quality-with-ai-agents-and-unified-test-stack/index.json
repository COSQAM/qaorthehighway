That’s the top concern we’ve heard from across our 50,000+ customers.\n\nOver the past two years, we’ve worked closely with thousands of them to solve the actual problems of AI adoption. The result? A 10x boost in productivity, a 50% jump in coverage, and a 40% reduction in build failures  —all through practical, targeted applications of AI where it matters most.\n\nIn this session, I’ll walk you through how leading teams at companies like GM, PayPal, and L’Oréal are using AI agents and BrowserStack’s Unified Test Stack to drive measurable results. You’ll see live demos across key use cases—like instant test generation, intelligent test selection, visual testing, and low-code automation—plus real benchmarks comparing AI-driven workflows with manual efforts and generic LLMs like ChatGPT.\n\nIf you’re a QA leader, developer, or tester looking to deliver quality at scale, this session will give you a clear, practical view into what’s working—and how to stay ahead as testing enters the AI era.","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ganeshrammahalingam/","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
