They rush to get a testing tool in place because it will “solve most of their manual testing problems.” Then spend a hard 6-12 months implementing a solution which isn’t quite fitting their needs.

As the time to renew licenses approaches your faced with a hard decision: replace this tool with another (potentially repeating the difficult implementation process for a second time next year) OR grind it out and adjust your processes to make the tool fit. Neither path is a good one.\n\nA more important question to ask is “How did you get yourself into this difficult position to begin with?” As I talk to more and more organizations in this difficult position, I see a pattern emerging. None of them have an over-arching Test Strategy in place. The tool they chose isn’t solving “most of their manual testing problems” because they have not taken the time to thoroughly identify what all those problems are, they have not taken the time to thoroughly identify where they think they want to be in 2 or 5 years, and they have not taken the time to think through how Tool A or B can help them through their journey from current to future state.\n\nA well put-together Test Strategy can help you guide these treacherous waters.

Where (which environments) will these test be executed in? When will these tests be executed? Who will create, monitor and maintain the tests?

Data proves that it is 10X more costly to correct a problem than to prevent it.\n\nIT Organizations are transforming their business models to be digital and product-centric which, in turn, is forcing the need to get things right the first time, and with increased speed. Traditional application centric quality assurance models with dedicated QA teams driven by standard QA SLAs have become a bottleneck to achieve the intended business goals. This has resulted in organizations transforming from Quality control to a Quality Engineering approach, shifting left within the SDLC lifecycle by embedding intelligent automation with self-healing, integrating Dev-QA model & business quality assurance, and embarking on a Quality Engineering transformation journey.\n\nWith this raised bar on expectations from quality engineering, what aspects of testing need to be considered to realize the full benefits, preventing potential risks, and effectively contributing to business objectives?\n\nJoin us for a presentation and discover on how to reduce cost of quality, achieve speed, and move the needle from detection to prevention!\n\nQuestions we will cover include:\n- What does the future of Quality engineering will look like?\n- What are the key considerations for Quality Engineering?\n- What tools and accelerators are available in the market?\n- How can I transform my team to enable QE?\n- How can I perform effective change management associated with culture and mindset?","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Interfaith Room","path":"/mark-harris/from-detection-to-prevention-a-how-to-guide"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Sarah Geisinger","speaker2":"","title":"Understanding the Continuous Testing Metrics That Matter","summary":"Measuring and tracking the right KPIs and ensuring they’re widely available across your teams are keys to success and driving a culture of quality.
