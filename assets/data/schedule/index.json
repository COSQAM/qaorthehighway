I was approached by a tech company experiencing rapid global growth, with the exception of Indonesia. After conducting a localised functional test, we found the ‘last name’ field was compulsory when signing up to the app. But - why wouldn’t you enter a last name? Why was this so significant? It turns out that 40% of the Indonesian population doesn’t have a surname (due to the country’s political history) and therefore couldn’t sign up.\n\nOnce this field was removed, user adoption increased and unlocked a market of 262 million people. We already knew testing could provide valuable results, but it was this particular case that showed us it’s true value, and how it has a measurable impact on business growth.\n\nBy searching deeper, to figure out if this case was just an outlier, I interviewed over 120 of the world’s top leaders in QA and Engineering from companies such as Etsy, Google, Airbnb, HelloFresh and more. I was able to uncover how the world’s most successful tech companies deliver high-quality software and accelerate growth - the focus of my talk.\n\nI discovered that, at the heart of every successful quality team, was a leader who had determined how to effectively leverage quality strategy to accelerate business growth. Learn the secret to how the world’s top-performing QA and Engineering leaders change cultures of quality, to one that allows them to deliver high-quality software with speed, and accelerate the growth of their business. Learn how they shift company perspectives on the value of testing, to future-proofing your product for world-class customer experiences.","time":"8:00 - 9:00","room":"East Ballroom","path":"/ronald-cummings-john/develop-a-quality-narrative-that-communicates-the-true-value-of-quality"}}]},"session2":{"edges":[{"node":{"speaker":"Jerren Every","speaker2":"","title":"Pragmatic Automation Practices","summary":"A grounded conversation regarding implementation and optimization of test automation.","abstract":"This session will provide a how-to style guide that takes the user through the lifecycle of automation including:\n\n- What factors to take into account while choosing tools.\n- What goals are realistic for test automation.\n- What should the first priorities be.\n- How does one know when an automation suite is Mature.\n- Common pitfalls and mistakes to avoid.\n- At what point(s) should we decide against automation.\n- What sort of fine-tuning and optimizing is possible with automation.

While there are parallels, it's also easy to gloss over the differences. Manufacturing processes are, by definition, repeatable. Software development, in contrast, is often messier than we care to admit, because it's developed by fallible humans, not robots.\n\nSo let's shift left and find ways to catch defects earlier or prevent them in the first place. Let's understand what it means for testing to be everyone's responsibility. But let's also get more specific about what that means for each role. Let's also acknowledge that no matter how much we streamline and improve our development processes, nothing in software is infallible.

Business pressures are accelerating expectations for how fast new features are released into production. Agile cycles are increasing our release frequency for delivering those features. DevOps is disrupting the entire pipeline and enabling organizations to truly differentiate themselves from the competition.\n\nOften our testing practices are stuck at the end of the development cycle and short-changed due to time overruns earlier in the lifecycle. QA is getting stuck to right rather than shifting left. However, DevOps and continuous flow concepts are changing when, how, and how often testing can be done.\n\nContinuous Testing enables a true “shift left” for testing elements and provides agility for how those testing elements are accomplished. Continuous Testing helps you succeed in this new high-speed reality.\n\nEnsuring quality is not a simple task. It has become more complex with the new pressures, directions,and requirements that today’s QA organizations face such as: many different types of testing, “stuck right, and left behind by DevOps. Continuous Testing can help address these QA challenges.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll address the technology, process, people, and cultural changes Continuous Testing requires. I’ll also explore how Continuous Testing helps QA keep pace and why QA must move towards a continuous testing footing to achieve fast, predictable, quality DevOps and delivery.\n\nTakeaways from this talk\nAttendees will become more familiar with, or be introduced to, Continuous Testing including its drivers,QA challenges, as well as the key elements that make up Continuous Testing. We’ll delve into how Continuous Testing is enabling a true “shift left” for testing elements and providing agility for how those testing elements are accomplished.\n\nA key takeaway includes the nine key elements teams must-have in order to be successful in moving towards a Continuous Testing footing and DevOps concepts.\n\nThese Continuous Testing elements include:\n• Shift Left: Key to moving testing to earlier in the lifecycle and pipeline\n• Test Automation: Critical to meet faster cycle requirements and maintain confidence and quality\n• Pipeline Integration: Properly fitting QA into the life cycle and tool chain to connect traditional silos\n• Ephemeral Environments: Building ephemeral environments that can be consistently, quickly and cost effectively spun up and torn down\n• Test Data Management: Virtual, masked, production-quality data\n• Continuous Monitoring: Monitoring throughout the lifecycle and environment stack\n• Service Virtualization: Virtualization capabilities allowing test to execute regardless of availability\n• Change Culture: Changing the way people think at every level of the organization, the way people are connected, and the way they work\n• Align People and Organization: Shifting responsibilities and empowering many teams and individuals to contribute to the quality of delivery\n\nNo matter where you are on your Continuous Testing journey, the audience will learn how a pragmatic roadmap and high-quality delivery that will help your organization maximize quality while keeping pace with today’s business requirements.\n\nThe outcome?

The opening track, Bad Boys Running Wild, speaks to me about test automation running amok in a DevOps environment. The lyrics include “if you don't play along with their games” which certainly had no relation to the concept of DevOps at the time, but perhaps now they do.\n\nWhen testing in a CI/CD pipeline, we often think “just create a task that fails the deployment if any tests fail”. Mechanically, that thought is not far off base. Practically, however, there are many facets of this flavor of testing that we must consider when running automated tests in a pipeline. Typically, the biggest considerations are execution duration and consistency; we don't want to wait “too long” for our deployment and we want the tests to behave the same way on each execution.\n\nRunning our automated test scripts in parallel can absolutely reduce the duration of an automation suite’s execution. Having success and consistency with concurrent execution, however, requires upfront work to obtain detailed knowledge of the application being tested and dependencies in the automation suite. Omitting this work will result in our automation being unable to get out of its way; automation will inevitably run wild.\n\nAdditionally, a deploy-on-every-commit, possibly even to production, is the end goal for many teams. There are additional considerations for being able to accomplish this goal because it’s likely no humans will touch the modified software until it’s actually in production.

This car has been *full* of problems, but that’s not much different than the apps we test. In this keynote, I’ll tell you the whole story, from blowing up the engine to rebuilding it myself. I had never worked on cars before, but my software engineering skills helped me tremendously. I’ll also share how I learned a few things from cars that transferred into my software practices. Whether running tests with automation or shifting gears with a manual transmission, certain skills remained invaluable, like curiosity, tenacity, and ingenuity.
