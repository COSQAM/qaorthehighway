With over 35 years of combined project experience, we've seen it all. Your two hosts, an architect and a project manager, will help shed some light on what not to do. In this talk, we've compiled a list of the biggest mistakes we've seen our team members make on projects. It doesn't matter what your role is. We have tips for developers, business analysts and even our quality assurance members. Good projects, great projects or even hot messes have mistakes and we've seen them. Join for the tips but stay for the banter. The architect and PM don't always agree. =)","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","path":"/heath-murphy/12-things-your-architect-and-pm-wish-youd-stop-doing-on-the-project"}}]},"session3":{"edges":[]},"session4":{"edges":[]},"session5":{"edges":[]},"session6":{"edges":[]},"session7":{"edges":[{"node":{"speaker":"Ronald Cummings-John","speaker2":"","title":"** Session information coming soon **","summary":"** Session information coming soon **","abstract":"** Session information coming soon **","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","path":"/ronald-cummings-john/session-information-coming-soon"}}]}},"context":{}}
