Re-Evaluating Its Role in Modern Development","abstract":"Gherkin is a domain-specific language used to define test cases in a human-readable format, primarily for behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows stakeholders, including non-technical team members, to understand and contribute to software specifications. Gherkin uses keywords like \"Feature\", \"Scenario\", \"Given\", \"When\", \"Then\", \"And\", and \"But\" to structure test scenarios.\n\nGherkin is probably sabotaging your development process.

Let's talk about situations where it can cause significant problem when building automated test cases and how to use it properly.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfornal/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/rfornal","website":"https://code-squid.com","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/@bob-fornal","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
