This car has been *full* of problems, but that’s not much different than the apps we test. In this keynote, I’ll tell you the whole story, from blowing up the engine to rebuilding it myself. I had never worked on cars before, but my software engineering skills helped me tremendously. I’ll also share how I learned a few things from cars that transferred into my software practices. Whether running tests with automation or shifting gears with a manual transmission, certain skills remained invaluable, like curiosity, tenacity, and ingenuity. Come learn from my mistakes so that you can build things better, whatever you choose to build.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-leland-knight/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda","website":"https://automationpanda.com/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
