Have you felt a divide between your testing team and other engineering or product teams within your organization? At Storyblocks, we’ve built a bridge between product, engineering, stakeholders, and our testing team, forming a productive and cooperative environment. In this session, Ben will walk through how his testing team has built that relationship over time. He will review why testing teams may find themselves isolated in their organization to the point where the relationship between the testing team and others feels combative. He will review the impact this has on the organization. He’ll look into strategies such as building communication, empathy, early team-building exercises across teams, and trust or testing as a whole team approach to help dig out of the silo and create open communication channels shared across your org.  So join him and learn how to create a more collaborative and productive environment in your organization.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/BenOconis","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
