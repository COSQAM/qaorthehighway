Every team should have a set of “ready” criteria that includes some kind of workshop between development team members to establish a shared understanding. In a time-boxed Example Mapping session, rules will summarize examples or constraints about a user story, and questions about outcomes or dependencies are documented for future refinement. The end result are requirements written as user behavior with a shared understanding among all roles on an Agile team. The audience will participate in a live Example Mapping session and learn how to implement the workshop within their own team.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"West Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-haver/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/COGSfun","website":"https://red-green-refactor.com/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
