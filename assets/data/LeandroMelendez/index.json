Especially nowadays.\n\nDo your teams need help accommodating those humongous load tests in your agile & continuous projects?\nDo you need frozen environments? Or, stop (freeze) all new changes until you can execute your colossal test? Everything to find the limits of your cloud, elastic, and distributed application?\nAll of that struggle to repeat it because the metrics you've got became invalid with the next release?\nYou should reframe the perspective and stop focusing on generating a few massive load tests. Why not have Chihuahua-sized load tests?\nYou can have a lot of those! They are small, cute, and pretty fast. You can even carry them around with you!\n\nThe list of advantages goes on and on. In this session, Leandro will describe the advantages of these tiny and cute load tests, the reasons to stop focusing on St. Bernard-sized load tests, and some tips on how to get the most out of Chihuahua-sized load tests.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandromelendez/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/SrPerf","website":"www.srperf.com","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/@SrPerfEng","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
