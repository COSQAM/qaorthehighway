After spending over 20 years managing, developing, and deploying complex software/hardware systems for both commercial and Department of Defense (DoD) applications, Jeff founded Lighthouse in 2000 with the aim of establishing a company whose customer service was only eclipsed by the quality of its work. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of motivational leadership tactics and a wealth of expertise in software quality assurance (QA) processes and technical leadership, he’s both a hands-on company leader and the primary architect of Lighthouse’s celebrated workplace culture. When not at work, Jeff loves spending time with his family, baking bread, cheering for Penn State, and hiking.","bio2":"","title":"** Coming Soon **","abstract":"** Coming Soon **","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-van-fleet-381ba4/","twitter":"","website":"https://lighthousetechnologies.com/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
