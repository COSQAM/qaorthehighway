With thousands of test cases running across multiple devices, emulators, and cloud environments, traditional test execution strategies fail to scale, leading to slow feedback loops, high maintenance costs, and infrastructure bottlenecks.\n\nThis session explores cutting-edge strategies for building a scalable UI test execution infrastructure, leveraging orchestration tools, cloud-native solutions, and in-house hardware optimizations. We will dive into:\n- Optimizing test execution pipelines to reduce flakiness and speed up results\n- Scaling tests across cloud and in-house servers for cost-effective automation\n- Utilizing Kubernetes, Docker, and virtualized environments for parallel execution\n- Handling real vs. mock network dependencies in large-scale mobile UI testing\n- Ensuring CI/CD integration with tools like Marathon, Flank, and Xcodebuild\n\nWith real-world insights from large-scale test automation implementations, this talk provides practical solutions for QA leaders, automation engineers, and DevOps teams looking to future-proof their mobile test strategies. Whether youâ€™re running tests for a startup or a global enterprise, this session will equip you with the knowledge to build a robust, scalable, and high-performing UI test infrastructure.\n\nJoin us to learn how to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce test execution time, and take your mobile test automation to the next level!","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/igordorovskikh/","twitter":"","website":"https://marathonlabs.io/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/@DevHacks360","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
