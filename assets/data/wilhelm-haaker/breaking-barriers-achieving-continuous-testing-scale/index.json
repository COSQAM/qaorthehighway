Yet, as projects grow in complexity and testing scope, achieving the delicate balance between frequent releases and uncompromised quality becomes increasingly challenging. The methodology of short development iterations often clashes with the necessity of rigorous regression testing, threatening to erode the foundation of continuous testing.\n\nIn this session, we’ll discuss how to overcome the hurdles that impede achieving continuous testing at scale. Drawing from industry experience and best practices, we’ll tackle:\n• Too many UI tests. Explore innovative approaches to reduce dependence on UI testing, optimizing test coverage across the SDLC for efficiency and reliability.\n• Too many tests in general. Reduce the constantly increasing weight of regression tests that compromise QA's ability to keep up with development by adopting strategies that uphold testing effectiveness without sacrificing velocity.\n• Test environment constraints. Confront the challenges stemming from test environment availability and controllability through the strategic application of service virtualization.\n\nJoin us as we unravel the intricacies of continuous testing at scale, equipping your team with the tools and insights necessary to embrace a paradigm shift toward accelerated delivery without compromising on quality.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
