Traditional testing workflows often fall short in identifying subtle bugs, maintaining compliance, and addressing corner cases in complex codebases. This session explores how autonomous AI testing agents have evolved beyond co-pilot assistance to full autopilot capabilities, enabling seamless, end-to-end quality assurance with minimal human intervention.\n\nWhat Attendees Will Learn:\n* The differences between AI co-pilot and autopilot testing solutions and their impact on testing workflows.\n* Practical steps to integrate autonomous AI testing tools into DevOps pipelines with minimal disruption.\n* Strategies for achieving robust code integrity in GenAI-driven environments while addressing common challenges like missed corner cases and compliance risks.\n* Key metrics and KPIs for evaluating the success of AI-powered testing solutions in resource-limited teams.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunhaojiao/","twitter":"https://x.com/yunhaojiao","website":"https://testsprite.com","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
