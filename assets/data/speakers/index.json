It is the foundation of personal and professional relationships, leadership abilities, innovation, collaboration, business stability, entire nations, and much more. And often, trust is enough. However, misplaced trust—trusting the wrong thing, the wrong amount, or at the wrong time—can have significant, negative consequences.\n\nBut how can we know when trust is enough? And what do we do when it is not? By practicing skepticism!\n\nSkepticism is frequently equated with cynicism or pessimism, and skeptics are often seen as suspicious or even jaded. But, real skepticism is actually a neutral stance that suspends belief until justified evidence is available. Healthy skepticism is more closely aligned with curiosity and caution. And it can help us avoid negative consequences and move forward when trust is not enough.\n\nPracticing skepticism involves fact-checking, being aware of biases, asking good questions, and much more. And it is all especially relevant with the rise of Artificial Intelligence, a powerful yet complex technology. Understanding AI and practicing skepticism can help us use it effectively and safely.\n\nJoin me as I explore trust, promote skepticism, offer ways to develop a skeptical mindset, and show how these ideas apply to AI and other contexts by providing practical tips to better navigate our world.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","shortbio":"Helping build better people","shortbio2":"","path":"/damian-synadinos/trust-but-verify-expl-a-ined"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Jess Lancaster","speaker2":"","title":"Accessibility Testing as a Team Sport","abstract":"Accessibility testing and compliance can be daunting and it often falls to testers.

However, manual testing remains invaluable for tasks requiring human intuition, creativity, and exploratory skills. This paper explores how organizations can effectively transform their QA strategy to embrace automation without losing the benefits of manual testing, particularly when faced with challenges such as increased test complexity, growing product scope, and the need for faster release cycles. By leveraging low-code solutions such as Mabl, companies can enhance efficiency, improve test coverage, and scale their operations without completely overhauling their workforce. Factorio is a strategy game that emphasizes automation and efficiency, requiring players to gradually replace manual labor with automated systems to scale production. Drawing insights from this game, this paper illustrates the balance between manual and automated processes in software testing, demonstrating how a gradual shift to automation enables teams to focus on high-value tasks while maintaining manual testing where it adds the most value.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","shortbio":"QA Leader, Automation Evangelist, Gamer, Board Game Enthusiast, Dog Lover.","shortbio2":"","path":"/james-gould/why-measuring-matters"}},{"node":{"speaker":"David Vano","speaker2":"","title":"Eliminating Bottlenecks: Accelerating Development & Testing in a Complex Software Ecosystem","abstract":"Modern software development demands rapid iteration, seamless integration, and continuous testing across complex distributed systems.  However, dependencies on unavailable, costly, or evolving services create bottlenecks that hinder development and delay testing cycles. Traditional approaches fail to provide the flexibility and scalability required for efficient software delivery.\n\nThis session explores a methodology that enables teams to simulate dependencies with realistic, controlled responses, allowing development and testing to proceed uninterrupted.  By reducing constraints associated with third-party APIs, legacy systems, and evolving microservices, organizations can accelerate software delivery, improve test coverage, and enhance collaboration across teams. Attendees will learn how this approach integrates into CI/CD pipelines, supports automated testing strategies, and reduces operational costs while ensuring high software quality.\n\nJoin us to discover how adopting this strategy can transform the way your teams develop, test, and deploy software, eliminating common roadblocks that slow down innovation.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","shortbio":"CRO at Parasoft","shortbio2":"","path":"/david-vano/eliminating-bottlenecks-accelerating-development-testing-in-a-complex-software-ecosystem"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Chris Harbert","speaker2":"","title":"The Better Quality Movement: How We Can Advocate for a Better Digital World","abstract":"In an era where software shapes every corner of our lives — governing healthcare, finance, education, and even democracy — the consequences of poor-quality software extend far beyond bugs and crashes. They manifest in broken trust, systemic failures, and real-world harm. But whose responsibility is it to sound the alarm? Who will advocate for change not just within their teams, but across industries, governments, and global systems? The answer is _us_.\n\nThis talk will challenge and inspire you to think beyond your immediate role and organization to embrace a larger mission: being an advocate for quality as a societal value. Drawing upon lessons from successful community activism, we’ll explore how software development and testing professionals can raise awareness about the true cost of bad software, rally stakeholders across disciplines, and influence broader policies and standards. We have an opportunity --- and a moral obligation --- to be the voice for responsible software practices.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","shortbio":"Founder & CEO of Testery, Host of the Developers Who Test Podcast","shortbio2":"","path":"/chris-harbert/the-better-quality-movement-how-we-can-advocate-for-a-better-digital-world"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Damián Pereira","speaker2":"","title":"From Specs to Tests: Automating API Testing with AI","abstract":"AI-powered automation is transforming the way teams build and maintain API testing frameworks. In this talk, we’ll explore how AI can accelerate API automation by automatically generating test suites from OpenAPI specifications and Postman collections, significantly reducing manual effort and increasing test coverage.\n\nBy attending, you’ll learn how to:\nAccelerate API Automation: Understand how AI-driven approaches can streamline the creation of test suites, minimizing repetitive tasks and improving efficiency.\n\nEnhance Testing Confidence: Explore how AI-powered automation enhances test consistency, reliability, and maintainability.\n\nValidate AI Tools Effectively: Gain insights into the challenges of testing AI-driven automation and best practices for ensuring accuracy and trustworthiness.\n\nWe’ll begin with an overview of the foundational concepts behind AI-assisted API automation, followed by a demonstration of how AI can rapidly convert API definitions into comprehensive test suites.
