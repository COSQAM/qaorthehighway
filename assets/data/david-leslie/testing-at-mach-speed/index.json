His current professional focus is on test strategies for MACH projects, cloud testing of mobile applications, warehouse/order management system testing, and searching for ways to automate functional tests at the speed of agile. When heâ€™s not testing, he's watching the Alabama Crimson Tide and volunteering with the Civil Air Patrol where he works with young people interested in aerospace while working on his commercial drone pilot's license.","bio2":"","title":"Testing at MACH Speed","abstract":"Things we'll cover\n\nWhat is MACH architecture and why are companies like Express and Lego moved to it? \n\nThings to consider while test planning a MACH project.\n\nDealing with the complexity of testing when phases run together aka What does E2E look like?\n\nDiscussion and Tips on\n\nTesting Microservices and APIs (using REST)\n\nChallanges around cloud testing (both functional and performance tests)\n\nTesting the UI while the APIs are being built.","time":"1:55 - 2:55","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwleslie/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/davidwleslie","website":"https://www.ariessolutions.io/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
