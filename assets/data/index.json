I was approached by a tech company experiencing rapid global growth, with the exception of Indonesia. After conducting a localised functional test, we found the ‘last name’ field was compulsory when signing up to the app. But - why wouldn’t you enter a last name? Why was this so significant? It turns out that 40% of the Indonesian population doesn’t have a surname (due to the country’s political history) and therefore couldn’t sign up.\n\nOnce this field was removed, user adoption increased and unlocked a market of 262 million people. We already knew testing could provide valuable results, but it was this particular case that showed us it’s true value, and how it has a measurable impact on business growth.\n\nBy searching deeper, to figure out if this case was just an outlier, I interviewed over 120 of the world’s top leaders in QA and Engineering from companies such as Etsy, Google, Airbnb, HelloFresh and more. I was able to uncover how the world’s most successful tech companies deliver high-quality software and accelerate growth - the focus of my talk.\n\nI discovered that, at the heart of every successful quality team, was a leader who had determined how to effectively leverage quality strategy to accelerate business growth. Learn the secret to how the world’s top-performing QA and Engineering leaders change cultures of quality, to one that allows them to deliver high-quality software with speed, and accelerate the growth of their business. Learn how they shift company perspectives on the value of testing, to future-proofing your product for world-class customer experiences.","time":"8:00 - 9:00","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"Co-founder at Global App Testing and Co-author of Leading Quality","path":"/ronald-cummings-john/develop-a-quality-narrative-that-communicates-the-true-value-of-quality"}}]},"keynote2":{"edges":[{"node":{"speaker":"Andrew Knight","speaker2":"","title":"Fixing a Bug: The Automation Panda Goes Manual","abstract":"For the past three years, I’ve been working on a little bug - a 1970 Volkswagen Beetle, to be precise. This car has been *full* of problems, but that’s not much different than the apps we test. In this keynote, I’ll tell you the whole story, from blowing up the engine to rebuilding it myself. I had never worked on cars before, but my software engineering skills helped me tremendously. I’ll also share how I learned a few things from cars that transferred into my software practices. Whether running tests with automation or shifting gears with a manual transmission, certain skills remained invaluable, like curiosity, tenacity, and ingenuity. Come learn from my mistakes so that you can build things better, whatever you choose to build.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"The Automation Panda","path":"/andrew-knight/fixing-a-bug-the-automation-panda-goes-manual"}}]}},"context":{}}
