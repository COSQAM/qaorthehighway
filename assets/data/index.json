The phrase uses just a few, small words to express many, big ideas. And so, it is valuable and critical to understand what each word means individually in order to better understand the ideas they convey collectively.\n\nSemantics is the study of meaning in words. The session begins with a brief and broad overview of semantics and related ideas. This sets the stage for deep analysis of each individual word in the phrase above and its potential meaning. We collaboratively consider:\n\nTesters – What might this word mean to different people and in different contexts?\n\nDo/Don’t – What do normative and descriptive statements have to do with it?\n\nHelp – How does the inclusion/exclusion of this word affect the meaning of the phrase?\n\nPrevent/Detect – What does causality and relativism have to do with which word we choose?\n\nProblems – What exactly is the thing that is being prevented or detected?\n\nThis session demystifies and promotes semantics, and goes beyond wordplay to introduce critical concepts that have practical impacts on testers, their roles, and their responsibilities.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"Polymath at Ineffable Solutions"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Andrew Knight","speaker2":"","title":"Managing the Test Data Nightmare","abstract":"Good data for testing can be a nightmare to manage. Sometimes, teams don’t have much control over the data in their systems under test—it’s just dropped in, and it can change arbitrarily. Other times, teams need to build their own data sets, either before testing or during testing. Inaccurate data can leave test gaps. Incorrect or stale data can break tests. Large data can consume too much time. Ugh!\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover strategies for defeating many types of test data nightmares:\n\n* recognizing the difference between product data and test case data\n* deciding when to prepare data statically beforehand or dynamically during testing\n* using data to control how tests run or reflect product state\n* hard-coding values versus discovering data in the system\n* avoiding collisions on shared data\n\nThe strategies we cover can be applied to any project in any language, especially Django. After this talk, you will wake up from the nightmare and handle test data cleanly and efficiently like a pro!","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"The Automation Panda"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Melissa Tondi","speaker2":"","title":"Automation - We're Doing it Wrong","abstract":"The term automation as it pertains to software testing has been a driving force in defining the software testing industry. For many years, we've used it as a catch-all to determine whether a tester, testing team, or IT organization is successful. In this talk, we will discuss the five misconceptions that are pervasive within companies - including using a percentage or number of test cases to define success and specifying a title/role for those who automate and matrixing that role across teams versus embedding it within the project they are supporting. Melissa will discuss re-booting our current thinking of automation and show tactics to address the five misconceptions that have contributed to what many of us would consider one of the wedges that divide the testing industry. In addition, she will share practical and proven approaches you can take back with you to show immediate and valuable results.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"Quality and Process Engineering Enthusiast"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Jordan Powell","speaker2":"","title":"API Testing Made Easy","abstract":"API's are a vital part of how we build applications today. It's how we send data from point A to Point B. They are sort of like the planes, trains and automobiles of the digital world.\n\nThough they are a key piece to building applications, they aren't always easy to test. In this talk, I will show you how easy it is to write API tests using Cypress.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"Senior Developer Experience Engineer at Cypress.io"}}]}},"context":{}}
