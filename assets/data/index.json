Testing is everyone's responsibility! Prevent defects instead of detecting them later! Build quality in. An inevitable reference to Deming. Ready to play some Quality Engineering Bingo? In this talk, Caleb will cover common \"catch phrases\" associated with Quality Engineering, including both some of the strongest arguments in favor of QE concept, and where the logic falls short of justifying the complete elimination of dedicated testers.\n\nMany of the ideas of Quality Engineering in software are taken from the discipline of the same name in manufacturing. While there are parallels, it's also easy to gloss over the differences. Manufacturing processes are, by definition, repeatable. Software development, in contrast, is often messier than we care to admit, because it's developed by fallible humans, not robots.\n\nSo let's shift left and find ways to catch defects earlier or prevent them in the first place. Let's understand what it means for testing to be everyone's responsibility. But let's also get more specific about what that means for each role. Let's also acknowledge that no matter how much we streamline and improve our development processes, nothing in software is infallible. We still need to consider how we might be fooled, or miss something, and how we can improve our efforts to find defects after implementation as well.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"Context-Driven Tester, Speaker, and Scrum Master","path":"/caleb-crandall/quality-engineering-bingo-night"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Brian Hamilton","speaker2":"","title":"Shift Left - From Start Up to SAFe","abstract":"What is Shift Left?

But what about its applicability to performance testing? In this talk, Federico Toledo will introduce the \"Performance Testing Pyramid,\" a novel adaptation inspired by the Cohn pyramid for automated functional tests, a model that he and Leandro Melendez elaborated based on their experiences in different projects. This model redefines the strategy for performance testing in both Agile and waterfall methodologies. Discover how prioritizing unit-level automation, integrating service tests, and minimizing end-to-end automation can lead to more efficient and effective performance testing strategies. Understand the structure of the pyramid and explore the advantages and disadvantages of each layer. Furthermore, delve into the importance of client-side performance and the possibility of hybrid tests. Join us to uncover a revolutionary approach to performance testing, offering valuable insights for all testing professionals.\n\nTakeaways:\n- Gain insights into the \"Performance Testing Pyramid\" model and its direct application to optimize performance testing strategies.\n- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of prioritizing unit-level automation, integrating service tests, and minimizing end-to-end automation for performance testing.\n- Learn about the importance of client-side performance and the potential benefits of hybrid testing approaches.\n- Understand the optimal frequency of test executions and the impact of test automation on modern Agile projects.\n- Gain insights into running performance tests on different infrastructure environments and how it influences the reliability of results.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"CQO and Co-founder at Abstracta","path":"/federico-toledo/optimizing-performance-testing-unveiling-the-performance-testing-pyramid"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Lee Barnes","speaker2":"","title":"Path to Becoming a High-Value Test Automation Engineer","abstract":"So… you want to become a Test Automation Engineer (or hire and develop one)? While there’s quite a bit of information available about important technical and tool skills to master, there’s not enough discussion around the path to becoming an effective Test Automation Engineer that knows how to add VALUE. In my experience this had led to a proliferation of engineers who are proficient with tools and building frameworks but have skill and knowledge gaps, especially in software testing, that reduce the value they deliver with test automation.\n\nIn this talk, Lee will share his lessons learned from over 30 years of working with, and mentoring, hundreds of Test Automation Engineers. Whether you’re looking to get started in test automation or just want to improve your trade, this talk will give you a solid foundation and roadmap for ensuring your test automation efforts continuously add value. This talk is equally valuable for both aspiring Test Automation Engineers and those managing them! All attendees will take away a set of key foundational knowledge and a high-level learning path for leveling up test automation skills and ensuring they add value to their organizations.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"Chief Quality Officer at Forte Group / Software Quality & Testing Aficionado","path":"/lee-barnes/path-to-becoming-a-high-value-test-automation-engineer"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Zachary Hamm","speaker2":"","title":"Component Testing: Bridging the gap for frontend applications","abstract":"What are the most popular frameworks for website development that you’ve encountered today? It might be React, VueJS, Svelte, Angular, or HTMX. While original in their designs, a common theme for modern web development is to build using separate components that comprise a full web page. However, most testing occurs directly at a page-level, and usually only in a later stages or during “handoffs.” This creates a problem where there is a gap between unit and feature testing.\n\nEnter component testing: picture it as “unit testing,” but for individual web components. In this demo, we will demonstrate how modern test frameworks, like Cypress and WebDriverIO, allow for component testing, to “shift left” and perform regressions earlier in the cycle. This allows feature testing to be more focused and less comprehensive, while uniting a stronger formula for an automated test plan overall.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","shortbio":"Software Engineer and Automation Architect","path":"/zachary-hamm/component-testing-bridging-the-gap-for-frontend-applications"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Bret Gregersen","speaker2":"","title":"Performing as Expected: When and Why to Implement Performance Testing","abstract":"While functional QA is often a given when developing and integrating software, non-functional testing tends to take a back seat or be ignored completely.
