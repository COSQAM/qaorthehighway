I have published on QA practices, automation, and performance testing, and am interested in applying the best current theory to practical problems.","bio2":"","title":"QA on the Highway","abstract":"The challenges of QA for vehicle dashboards, and for control panel systems in general. Most vehicles nowadays have software-driven dashboards. This brings great flexibility, and a considerable challenge for QA. The vehicleâ€™s user interface may include several screens, interface to many separate vehicle control units (engine, safety, infotainment, etc.), communicate over many data channels (GPS, Bluetooth, CAN bus, mobile data), and may cooperate with phone apps and internet services. Defining the correct boundary for test systems and emulating, simulating, or controlling all the interfaces of the system is an interesting challenge.","time":"1:55 - 2:55","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerlhayes/","twitter":"","website":"https://www.mcanta.com","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvzcwY01AuNmJofK-qsymsHHmkYFUOQ_/view?usp=sharing"}},"context":{}}
