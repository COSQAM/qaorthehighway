Over the years, some things have changed for the better, some things haven't changed at all, and, unfortunately, some things have changed for the worse. In this talk, you’ll get my sometimes spicy—like ghost pepper spicy—takes on these things. Agree or disagree, I hope to get you re-thinking some things you might have taken for granted.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rex-black/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/RBCS","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
