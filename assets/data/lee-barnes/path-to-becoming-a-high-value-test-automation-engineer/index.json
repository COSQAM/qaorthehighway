While there’s quite a bit of information available about important technical and tool skills to master, there’s not enough discussion around the path to becoming an effective Test Automation Engineer that knows how to add VALUE. In my experience this had led to a proliferation of engineers who are proficient with tools and building frameworks but have skill and knowledge gaps, especially in software testing, that reduce the value they deliver with test automation.\n\nIn this talk, Lee will share his lessons learned from over 30 years of working with, and mentoring, hundreds of Test Automation Engineers. Whether you’re looking to get started in test automation or just want to improve your trade, this talk will give you a solid foundation and roadmap for ensuring your test automation efforts continuously add value. This talk is equally valuable for both aspiring Test Automation Engineers and those managing them! All attendees will take away a set of key foundational knowledge and a high-level learning path for leveling up test automation skills and ensuring they add value to their organizations.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leebarnes/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/USI_LeeBarnes","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
