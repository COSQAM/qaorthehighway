However, the shift towards digital technologies can often be complex and disruptive, requiring careful planning and execution. The shift left and shift right trends in DevOps have gained significant attention in recent years as organizations strive for digital transformation and a focus on quality. One aspect of this shift that is particularly important to consider is the balance between \"shift left\" and \"shift right\" in DevOps.\n\nShift left refers to the practice of involving testing and quality assurance earlier in the development process, while shift right emphasizes the importance of monitoring and testing in production. Effective digital transformation strategies must consider both shift left and shift right in order to deliver successful outcomes. This means ensuring that testing and quality assurance are integrated into the development process, while also monitoring and validating the product in production. \n\nJoin Manoj in this session to understand how a balanced approach to software development is crucial for optimal quality and ultimately achieving successful digital transformation.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Great Hall 3","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoj9788/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/manoj9788","website":"https://www.manojkk.com/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
