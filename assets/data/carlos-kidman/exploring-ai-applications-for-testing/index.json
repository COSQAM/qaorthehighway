This presentation will cover practical applications of AI that Testers and teams can use right now. For example, AI for functional testing or helping with Test Data Management. Not all are free, but examples will be shown so the audience can see them in action. Attendees will walk away with a list of multiple AI tools and how to apply them. They will understand the different problems that can be solved and how their efficiency, productivity, and overall testing can be improved by applying AI right now! AI won't replace Testers, but we should know how to leverage AI to make us better and raise our Quality.","time":"4:15 - 5:15","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-kidman/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CarlosKidman","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvYBOCETf7MByrYKDTU3fQ","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
