In this fun talk we'll talk about the value of side projects as a tool for perpetual learning, growth, emotional health, and career development in the tech world.\n\nWe'll tour the landscape of side projects and why you might want to pick one up, how to select a side project and get started with one, how to constrain the scope of a side project and make progress against it, and how to bring side projects to their inevitable conclusion.\n\nSide projects aren't easy, though, and so we'll talk about getting unstuck, finding time for side projects, what to do when you're bored of a side project (or tempted by a new one), and ways of growing and staying healthy in those seasons of life when side projects just aren't feasible.\n\nAlong the way, you'll hear some tales of interesting, innovative, amusing, and even horrifying side projects I've taken on over the years and hear a few specific ways that side projects have impacted myself and those I've had the privilege of mentoring.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteland/","twitter":"https://x.com/IntegerMan","website":"https://matteland.dev/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/c/MattEland","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
