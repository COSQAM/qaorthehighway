Testing teams have some of the biggest impacts to this inflicted urgency, by the need to create tests faster that cover the new features, as well as execute the tests at an even faster pace. Testers need to get immediate feedback not only on the manual results for new tests, but also existing automation suites that need to be evaluated.\n\nHyperExecute, LambdaTest’s cutting-edge Test Orchestration platform, is designed to streamline the testing lifecycle, reduce CI/CD costs, and provide deeper insights into test data. This session will explore how to revolutionize the way organizations manage automated testing, ensuring faster feedback loops, better resource utilization, and actionable analytics.
