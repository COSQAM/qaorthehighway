Many organizations have already integrated AI into their software development lifecycle, and the demand for AI-assisted engineering continues to grow year over year.  A key motivating factor behind the demand is the promise of increased speed and efficiency through automation. Software testing is a prime candidate for AI acceleration due to the generally high costs and significant manual effort involved in validation and verification.  As a result, we are seeing an exponential growth in the application and development of tools to support AI-driven test automation.c\n\nBut what does the adoption of AI-driven automation mean for the future of software testing?  Is AI going to replace manual testers and/or test automation engineers? It seems like these questions are quickly growing old and repetitive because no one is providing definitive answers based on practical, real-world analysis. Join industry expert Tariq King as he takes you on a journey into the future of software testing. Tariq firmly believes that AI will take over software testing and permanently transform the quality engineering landscape. He postulates that the future of testing will be focused on evaluating human experiences, including testing digital, physical, and experiential touchpoints. In the age of AI, human experience testing will not just be viewed as a quality assurance function, but as a core component of an organization’s business strategy. Welcome to the future of quality where AI specifies, designs, codes, and tests software, leaving the humans to do the one thing the machines can’t – test the human experience.","time":"8:00 - 9:00","room":"East Ballroom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tariqking","twitter":"https://x.com/@tariq_king","website":"https://medium.com/@tariq_king","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":"","slidesLink":""}},"context":{}}
